## About the project

### What are we going to make?

A car that is able to follow a path that is either extracted from an image (using image recognition) or drawn by the user.
Furthermore, the car can also be controlled using a gyroscope and the path taken will be drawn out by the car.

### Why will we make it?

In factories or warehouses, the floor plan is seldom standard.
This program can be utilized to draw paths for automation purposes which will fit with any layout.

### How are we going to make it?

The app will allow the user to create a grid-based drawing or upload a pre-made image on their Android phone; both of which will be converted into a path.
In the case of an uploaded image, image-processing will be used to convert the image to movement instructions for the car.

Technologies used:

- SmartCar
- Arduino IDE 1.8.19
- SMCE Emulator
- Android API
