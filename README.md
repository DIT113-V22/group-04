## About the project

---

### What are we going to make?

A car that is able to follow a path that is drawn by the user on the grid based canvas with or without the help of a background image. Also,
a previously saved path can be used by the car to traverse. The car can also move at an assigned speed (for e.g. the speed can be set to 50%). Furthermore, the 
car can also be controlled using a joystick and the path travelled can also be saved to be re-executed later.

### Why will we make it?

The car will be able to follow path. So this functionality can be used in factories or warehouses where the floor plan is seldom standard.
Thus, this program can be utilised to execute paths for automation purposes which will work with any layout.


On the other hand, the car will also be able to be controlled via a joystick and save the path that was driven.
This could be beneficial to, for example, Roombas (cleaning robot) as the user can manually set a path  once and 
then the roomba can save that path, so it is always able to clean the room/house in that specific order.

### How are we going to make it?

The android app will allow the user to create a grid-based drawing, which will be 
converted into movement instructions that the car recieves via HiveMQ broker and follows.
In the case of an uploaded background image, the app has a button.
With the use of the sensors and the SmartCar library, the car can follow the path safely and properly.

Technologies used:

- SmartCar
- SmartCar Shield Library
- Arduino IDE 1.8.19
- SMCE Emulator
- Android API
