## About the project

---

### What are we going to make?

A car that is able to follow a path that is either extracted from an image (using image recognition) or drawn by the user. Also,
a previously saved path can be used by the car to traverse. The car can also move at an assigned speed (for e.g. the speed can be set to 50%). Furthermore, the 
car can also be controlled using a gyroscope and the path taken will be drawn out by the car.

Possible Extensions
- Voice commands for path drawing (for example, draw a triangle of x dimensions)
- Back-tracking; i.e., the car will be able to get to its starting position after completing the drawing
- Manipulate the speed of the car to travel faster in some sections of the path and slower in others

### Why will we make it?

The car will be able to follow a given path. So this functionality can be used in factories or warehouses where the floor plan is seldom standard.
Thus, this program can be utilised to draw paths for automation purposes which will work with any layout.


On the other hand, the car will also be able to be controlled via a joystick and save the path that was driven.
This could be beneficial to, for example, Roombas (cleaning robot) as the user can manually set a path  once and 
then the roomba can save that path, so it is always able to clean the room/house in that specific order.

### How are we going to make it?

The mobile app will allow the user to create a grid-based drawing or upload a pre-made image on their Android phone; both of which will be 
converted into a path that the car can follow.
In the case of an uploaded image, image-processing will be used to convert the image to movement instructions for the car.
With the use of the sensors and the SmartCar library, the car can follow the path safely and properly.
